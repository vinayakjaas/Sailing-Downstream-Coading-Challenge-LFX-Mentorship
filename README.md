# LFX Mentorship Sailing Downship Coding Challenge

### PS

Write a Javascript, Python, or OCaml program that:
- accepts a list of integers
- emits an error message if the list is not a multiple of 10 in length
- returns or prints a list of integers based on the input list, but with items at positions which are a multiple of 2 or 3 removed
Host your program at a public git-based repository and include robust testing for your program.

### Language / Technologies Used
- Python >= 3.10
- `unittests` for unit testing (standard python package)


### Project Structure / Description

This project has a single python package, `reducelist` that has a single module, `reducer`. To import the package:

```python

```


To run unit tests, you can either run the module directly (from commandline):
